  abstract     = {{In the past, longitudinal beam profiles have been measured with e.g., Feschenko monitors*, Fast Faraday Cups (FFC)** and field monitors. Feschenko monitors usually examine an average shape over several pulses and FFCs are interceptive devices by design. In this work we want to present the progress in the development of a novel GHz diffraction radiation monitor which shall be able to measure the longitudinal charge distribution of single bunches within Hadron beam LINACS non-destructively. A proof-of-concept measurement has been performed at GSI. We aim for a resolution of 50 to 100ps at beam energies of β=0.05 to 0.74. electronic field simulations were performed using CST Particle Studio to determine an optimal RF-Window, which also suits as vacuum chamber and the beam energy and angular dependencies of the diffraction radiation for different materials were analyzed.}},

The luminosity has been increasing since then and the present highest luminosity is 4.65 x 10³⁴ cm⁻²s⁻¹ with β_{y}^{*} of 1 mm. The increase of the luminosity was brought with an application of crab waist, by increasing beam currents and by other improvements in the specific luminosity. In this paper, we describe what we have achieved and what we are struggling with. Finally, we mention a future plan briefly.}},

Recently proton beam with energies less than 10 MeV, <1\% energy spread, several to tens of pC charge can be stably produced and transported in Compact LAser Plasma Accelerator (CLAPA) at Peking University. The CLAPA beam line is an object-image point analysing system, which ensures the transmission efficiency and energy selection accuracy for proton beams with initial large divergence angle and energy spread. A spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) is produced with high precision beam control, which is essential for cancer therapy. Other primary application experiments based on laser-accelerated proton beam have also been carried out, such as FLASH irradiation, Laser Ion trace probe, proton radiograph, stress testing for tungsten, irradiation of semiconductor sensor to simulate the space irradiation environment and so on.}},

  abstract     = {{Beam-driven plasma-wakefield acceleration (PWFA) is one of the most promising techniques to reduce significantly the size and cost of future lepton accelerators. Huge steps have been taken in the last decades towards achieving high acceleration gradients with simultaneous beam-quality preservation. However, in order to match both the luminosity demands of high-energy physics and the brilliance requirements of photon science, PWFA must be capable of accelerating thousands of bunches per second ’ orders of magnitude beyond the current state of the art. Historically, investigation of the rate limitation in plasmas was limited by the number of bunches available from the accelerator front-end. The FLASHForward facility, which is driven by the superconducting linac of the FLASH free-electron laser, is the first experiment capable of addressing this issue. We report here on first experimental results from the facility, aimed at determining the repetition rate limit of plasma accelerators arising from fundamental plasma processes* and finally advancing the repetition rate of PWFA from proof-of-principle experiments at a few bunches per second to a competitive plasma accelerator.}},

  abstract     = {{Next generation particle accelerators craft increasingly high brightness beams to achieve physics goals for applications ranging from colliders to free electron lasers to studies of nonperturbative QED. Such rigorous requirements on total charge and shape introduce diagnostic challenges for effectively measuring bunch parameters prior to or at interaction points. We report on the simulation and training of a non-destructive beam diagnostic capable of characterizing high intensity charged particle beams. The diagnostic consists of a tailored neutral gas curtain, electrostatic microscope, and high sensitivity camera. An incident electron beam ionizes the gas curtain, while the electrostatic microscope transports generated ions to an imaging screen. Simulations of the ionization and transport process are performed using the Warp code. Then, a neural network is trained to provide accurate estimates of the initial electron beam parameters. We present initial results for a range of beam and gas curtain parameters and comment on extensibility to other beam intensity regimes.}},

  abstract     = {{The detailed design and optimization of accelerators has historically relied on high-fidelity simulations whose computational requirements limit their use as online tools. Recently, a growing community has begun reducing this computational burden by applying techniques from machine learning. For example, by learning from a sparse sampling of physics simulations one can develop fast-executing "surrogate models" that approximately predict accelerator performance for entirely new design parameters. Using these models can reduce compute times for multi-objective optimization studies by several orders of magnitude. In addition, surrogate models are now being applied in operational settings to enable non-invasive diagnostics and real-time optimization. This talk will cover developments in this field, applications to medium-energy electron photoinjectors, and how such surrogate models may improve our physics understanding of present and future accelerators.}},
